# RealFaces_w_StableDiffusion
Git Repo with code and Dataset of the paper "On the limitations of Stable Diffusion: from generation to detection of realistic images".
This Repo contains the code used to generate the fake Dataset proposed in the paper and the code used for the overall analysis. The other dataset cited and linked are NOT proposed by us and the credits goes to the original creators.

## Work in progress...

## How to run the code

### Fake Images Generation
To generate the images we used Stable Diffusion v1.5 available at HuggingFace. In order to use it, you have to send a request and accept the terms of service. Done this you will receive a token that, in the code "main.py", must be inserted in the variable "YOUR_TOKEN", row 22, in the place of 'your_Stable_Diffusion_token'.

### Classifiers codes and Datasets
The fake dataset must be downloaded from the link stated below, extracted and put in the datasets/png_images/train, datasets/png_images/eval and datasets/png_images/test folder naming the subfolders "fake".

The real dataset must be split, running the "split_real_dataset.py" file, in order to run the classifiers codes (The FFHQ dataset must be downloaded first from the link stated below, and then moved in the datasets folder, naming the subfolder containing all the images "archive").

To run the 5_classes_classifier one has to download the StyleGAN datasets from the link stated below, then move them in the path "datasets/gan", "datasets/gan2" and "datasets/gan3" and run the "split_5classes_dataset.py" file.

## Dataset
%insert images

The fake generated dataset that we propose is available at the drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10-n9jY3USb5O_2bh4yUpo1IRPWxe1RIA; however new and different images can be generated using the code "main.py".

The real dataset used in this project for detetction and classification purpose is the FFHQ dataset, available on kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnaud58/flickrfaceshq-dataset-ffhq.

The other GAN datasets used for classification are not created by us. They are generated by the three different versions of the stylegan model: stylegan, stylegan 2 (used for the famous website https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/) and stylegan 3.

The stylegan dataset is available at: https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/deepfakechallenge/#[object%20Object], or you can download it directly from here: https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/deepfakechallenge/training/1-STYLEGAN.zip;

The stylegan2 dataset is available on Kaggle at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bwandowando/all-these-people-dont-exist

The stylegan3 dataset is available at: https://nvlabs-fi-cdn.nvidia.com/stylegan3/images/

## Data preprocessing
In order to balance the real and fake datasets, we tried to remove all the children in the real dataset (because there are no children in the fake one) using the code available at https://www.thepythoncode.com/article/predict-age-using-opencv/.
The "weights" folder is empty. It have to be filled by the model downloadable from the sites cited in the file "remove_children.py".
